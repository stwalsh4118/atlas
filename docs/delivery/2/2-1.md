# [2-1] Research and document GORM + PostGIS integration

[Back to task list](./tasks.md)

## Description

Research and document the approach for integrating GORM with PostGIS geometry types. GORM does not have native PostGIS support, so we need to understand how to:
1. Create custom Go types for PostGIS geometry (specifically Polygon type)
2. Use raw SQL for spatial queries while using GORM for standard CRUD operations
3. Handle GeoJSON serialization/deserialization

This task will create a technical guide documenting the integration approach with example code snippets.

## Requirements

1. Research GORM custom type implementation for PostGIS geometry
2. Research golang-migrate compatibility with GORM
3. Find example implementations of GORM + PostGIS integration
4. Document approach with code examples
5. Create a guide file documenting the integration pattern
6. Include GeoJSON parsing examples (for Montgomery County data format)

## Implementation Plan

1. Web search for "GORM PostGIS custom type implementation"
2. Research paulmach/orb library for Go geometry types
3. Research twpayne/go-geom as alternative
4. Review golang-migrate documentation for GORM compatibility
5. Create guide document: `2-1-gorm-postgis-guide.md`
6. Document:
   - Custom Polygon type implementation
   - GORM Scanner/Valuer interface implementation
   - Raw SQL approach for spatial queries
   - GeoJSON parsing from Montgomery County format
   - Example CRUD operations
   - Migration strategy

## Test Plan

**Objective**: Ensure the documented approach is technically sound and implementable

**Test Scope**: Documentation validation (no code implementation in this task)

**Key Test Scenarios**:
1. Documentation includes clear code examples for custom geometry type
2. Documentation explains how to use GORM for CRUD and raw SQL for spatial queries
3. Documentation includes GeoJSON parsing example matching Montgomery County format
4. Documentation explains golang-migrate integration approach

**Success Criteria**: 
- Guide document created with all required sections
- Approach is clear and actionable for implementation in subsequent tasks
- Examples are syntactically correct Go code

## Verification

- [x] Guide document created at `docs/delivery/2/2-1-gorm-postgis-guide.md`
- [x] Document includes custom Polygon type implementation
- [x] Document includes Scanner/Valuer interface example
- [x] Document includes raw SQL spatial query example
- [x] Document includes GeoJSON parsing example
- [x] Document includes links to source documentation
- [x] Document recommends gormgis library as primary approach
- [x] Document includes GeoJSON parsing for Montgomery County format
- [x] Document includes migration approach with golang-migrate

## Implementation Notes

- Researched GORM + PostGIS integration patterns via web search
- Identified `gormgis` library as primary solution for PostGIS type support
- Documented fallback custom type implementation with Scanner/Valuer interfaces
- Included complete GeoJSON parsing examples for Montgomery County data format
- Documented raw SQL approach for spatial queries (ST_Contains, ST_Intersects)
- Confirmed golang-migrate works independently of GORM
- Guide includes performance considerations and indexing strategies
