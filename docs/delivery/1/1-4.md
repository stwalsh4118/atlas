# [1-4] Initialize Next.js frontend project

[Back to task list](./tasks.md)

## Description

Initialize a Next.js 15 project in `web/nextjs/` using TypeScript and the App Router. Configure with ESLint, TypeScript strict mode, and set up the basic project structure for development.

## Requirements

1. Initialize Next.js 15 project with TypeScript
2. Use App Router (app/ directory)
3. Configure ESLint for code quality
4. Use pnpm as package manager
5. Set up TypeScript with strict mode
6. Create basic page to verify setup

## Implementation Plan

1. Navigate to `web/nextjs/` directory
2. Run `pnpm create next-app@latest .` with options:
   - TypeScript: Yes
   - ESLint: Yes
   - Tailwind CSS: Yes (for styling)
   - App Router: Yes
   - Turbopack: Yes (for faster dev)
3. Configure `tsconfig.json` with strict mode
4. Update `next.config.js` if needed
5. Test dev server with `pnpm dev`

## Test Plan

**Objective**: Verify Next.js project is properly initialized and runs

**Key Test Scenarios**:
1. `pnpm install` completes successfully
2. `pnpm dev` starts development server
3. Can access localhost on dev port
4. `pnpm build` creates production build
5. ESLint runs without errors

**Success Criteria**: Development server runs, build succeeds, basic page loads

## Verification

- [ ] `web/nextjs/package.json` exists with Next.js 15
- [ ] `web/nextjs/tsconfig.json` exists with strict mode
- [ ] `web/nextjs/next.config.js` exists
- [ ] `web/nextjs/app/` directory exists
- [ ] `pnpm install` completes successfully
- [ ] `pnpm dev` starts development server
- [ ] Can access application in browser
- [ ] `pnpm build` succeeds
- [ ] `pnpm lint` runs without errors
