## Requirements

1. Initialize Next.js 15 project with TypeScript
2. Use App Router (app/ directory)
3. Configure ESLint for code quality
4. Use pnpm as package manager
5. Set up TypeScript with strict mode
6. Create basic page to verify setup

## Implementation Plan

1. Navigate to `web/nextjs/` directory
2. Run `pnpm create next-app@latest .` with options:
   - TypeScript: Yes
   - ESLint: Yes
   - Tailwind CSS: Yes (for styling)
   - App Router: Yes
   - Turbopack: Yes (for faster dev)
3. Configure `tsconfig.json` with strict mode
4. Update `next.config.js` if needed
5. Test dev server with `pnpm dev`

## Test Plan

**Objective**: Verify Next.js project is properly initialized and runs

**Key Test Scenarios**:
1. `pnpm install` completes successfully
2. `pnpm dev` starts development server
3. Can access localhost on dev port
4. `pnpm build` creates production build
5. ESLint runs without errors

**Success Criteria**: Development server runs, build succeeds, basic page loads

## Implementation Notes

- Initialized Next.js 15.5.6 with TypeScript, App Router, ESLint, Tailwind CSS v4, and Turbopack
- TypeScript configured with strict mode enabled in tsconfig.json
- Used pnpm as package manager per project requirements
- Project includes:
  - React 19.1.0 and React DOM 19.1.0
  - TypeScript 5.9.3 with strict mode
  - ESLint 9.38.0 with Next.js configuration
  - Tailwind CSS 4.1.14 with PostCSS
  - Import alias configured as `@/*` pointing to project root
- **shadcn/ui installed with all components**:
  - 54+ UI components added to `components/ui/`
  - Includes: accordion, alert, button, card, dialog, form, input, select, table, sidebar, and many more
  - Custom hook `use-mobile` added for responsive detection
  - CSS variables configured in globals.css
  - All dependencies installed (radix-ui primitives, etc.)
- Development server starts with Turbopack in 683ms
- Production build succeeds in 1154ms
- All linting passes without errors
- App directory structure created with:
  - layout.tsx (root layout)
  - page.tsx (home page)
  - globals.css (global styles with shadcn variables)
  - favicon.ico

## Verification

- [x] `web/nextjs/package.json` exists with Next.js 15.5.6
- [x] `web/nextjs/tsconfig.json` exists with strict mode enabled
- [x] `web/nextjs/next.config.ts` exists
- [x] `web/nextjs/app/` directory exists with layout and page files
- [x] `web/nextjs/components/ui/` directory exists with 54 shadcn components
- [x] `pnpm install` completes successfully (329 packages installed)
- [x] `pnpm dev` starts development server (ready in 683ms)
- [x] Can access application in browser (http://localhost:3000)
- [x] `pnpm build` succeeds with all components (compiled in 1336ms)
- [x] `pnpm lint` runs without errors
