# [1-6] Configure development tooling

[Back to task list](./tasks.md)

## Description

Configure consistent development tooling across the project including golangci-lint for Go code, ESLint/Prettier for TypeScript, and any shared configurations that should be consistent across all services.

## Requirements

1. Configure golangci-lint for Go API (if not already done in 1-3)
2. Ensure ESLint configurations are consistent across frontends
3. Add any shared editor configurations (.editorconfig)
4. Add any shared formatting configurations
5. Document how to run linters in each project

## Implementation Plan

1. Review and enhance `api/.golangci.yml` if needed
2. Ensure Next.js and Vue ESLint configs are compatible
3. Create `.editorconfig` at project root for consistent formatting
4. Add VS Code settings recommendations if useful (.vscode/settings.json)
5. Document linting commands in each project's section

## Test Plan

**Objective**: Verify all linting tools are configured and functional

**Key Test Scenarios**:
1. `golangci-lint run` works in api/ directory
2. `pnpm lint` works in web/nextjs/
3. `pnpm lint` works in web/vue/
4. Editor configurations are consistent

**Success Criteria**: All linters run successfully without configuration errors

## Verification

- [ ] `api/.golangci.yml` is properly configured
- [ ] `web/nextjs/.eslintrc.json` is properly configured
- [ ] `web/vue/.eslintrc.cjs` is properly configured
- [ ] `.editorconfig` exists at project root (optional but recommended)
- [ ] All linters can be run successfully
- [ ] Linting documentation exists for developers

## Files Modified

- `api/.golangci.yml` (enhanced if needed)
- `web/nextjs/.eslintrc.json` (reviewed/enhanced)
- `web/vue/.eslintrc.cjs` (reviewed/enhanced)
- `.editorconfig` (new, optional)
- `.vscode/settings.json` (new, optional)
