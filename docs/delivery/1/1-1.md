# [1-1] Create Docker Compose configuration with PostgreSQL + PostGIS

[Back to task list](./tasks.md)

## Description

Set up Docker Compose configuration file that defines a PostgreSQL 18.0 service with PostGIS 3.5 extension. The service should be configured with proper health checks, volume persistence, and expose the database on port 5432 for local development access.

## Requirements

1. Docker Compose file version compatible with Docker Compose 2.30+
2. PostgreSQL 18.0 service with PostGIS 3.5 extension
3. Port mapping: 5432:5432 for database access
4. Named volume for data persistence
5. Health check configuration to ensure database is ready
6. Environment variables for database credentials
7. Service name should be clear and descriptive

## Implementation Plan

1. Create `docker-compose.yml` in project root
2. Define PostgreSQL service using official postgres:18 image with PostGIS
3. Configure environment variables:
   - POSTGRES_DB
   - POSTGRES_USER
   - POSTGRES_PASSWORD
4. Set up volume for data persistence
5. Add health check using pg_isready
6. Configure port exposure
7. Add restart policy

## Test Plan

Given the simplicity of this task (configuration file), the test plan focuses on basic functionality:

**Objective**: Verify Docker Compose configuration correctly starts PostgreSQL with PostGIS

**Key Test Scenarios**:
1. `docker-compose up` successfully starts the database service
2. Can connect to PostgreSQL on localhost:5432
3. PostGIS extension is available and can be queried
4. Health check reports healthy status
5. Data persists across container restarts

**Success Criteria**: All scenarios pass, database is accessible and PostGIS is functional

## Verification

- [x] docker-compose.yml exists at project root
- [x] `docker-compose up -d` starts services without errors
- [x] `docker-compose ps` shows postgres service as healthy
- [x] Can connect using: `psql -h localhost -U postgres -d atlas`
- [x] PostGIS extension can be enabled: `CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS postgis;`
- [x] Can query PostGIS version: `SELECT PostGIS_Version();` - Returns PostGIS 3.6
- [x] Volume persists data after `docker-compose down && docker-compose up`

## Implementation Notes

- Used `postgis/postgis:18-3.6` image which includes PostgreSQL 18 and PostGIS 3.6
- Removed obsolete `version` field from docker-compose.yml (deprecated in Compose 2.30+)
- Removed `PGDATA` environment variable to avoid permission issues
- PostGIS extension is pre-installed and automatically available in the image
- All health checks pass successfully
- Data persistence verified through container restart test

## Files Modified

- `docker-compose.yml` (new)
