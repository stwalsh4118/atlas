# [1-2] Create project directory structure

[Back to task list](./tasks.md)

## Description

Create the complete directory structure for the mono-repo project, including directories for the Go API backend, Next.js and Vue.js frontends, utility scripts, and documentation. The structure should use `api/` and `web/` as the top-level service directories.

## Requirements

1. Create `api/` directory structure for Go backend:
   - `api/cmd/server/` - Entry point for API server
   - `api/internal/config/` - Configuration management
   - `api/internal/models/` - Data models
   - `api/internal/handlers/` - HTTP handlers
   - `api/internal/services/` - Business logic services
   - `api/internal/database/` - Database connection and queries

2. Create `web/` directory structure for frontends:
   - `web/nextjs/` - Next.js frontend
   - `web/vue/` - Vue.js frontend

3. Create supporting directories:
   - `scripts/` - Utility scripts
   - `docs/technical/` - Technical documentation (delivery/ already exists)

## Implementation Plan

1. Create api/ directory and subdirectories
2. Create web/ directory and subdirectories for both frontends
3. Create scripts/ directory
4. Create docs/technical/ directory (docs/delivery/ already exists)
5. Add .gitkeep files to empty directories to ensure they're tracked

## Test Plan

Given the simplicity of this task (creating directories), the test plan is minimal:

**Objective**: Verify all required directories are created

**Success Criteria**: All directories exist and follow the specified structure

## Verification

- [x] `api/cmd/server/` directory exists
- [x] `api/internal/config/` directory exists
- [x] `api/internal/models/` directory exists
- [x] `api/internal/handlers/` directory exists
- [x] `api/internal/services/` directory exists
- [x] `api/internal/database/` directory exists
- [x] `web/nextjs/` directory exists
- [x] `web/vue/` directory exists
- [x] `scripts/` directory exists
- [x] `docs/technical/` directory exists
- [x] Directory structure matches the pattern defined in PBI 1 prd.md

## Implementation Notes

- Created all required directories using `mkdir -p` to ensure parent directories are also created
- Added `.gitkeep` files to all empty directories to ensure they're tracked in git
- Directory structure follows the pattern defined in PBI 1 with `api/` and `web/` as top-level service directories
- All subdirectories created successfully and verified with `tree` command

## Files Modified

- Multiple directories created (new)
- `.gitkeep` files added to maintain directory structure in git (new)
