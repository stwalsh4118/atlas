# [3-6] Implement progress logging

[Back to task list](./tasks.md)

## Description

Add comprehensive logging to the import pipeline to track progress, performance metrics, and errors. This will provide visibility into long-running imports and help troubleshoot issues when they occur.

## Requirements

1. Log import start time and end time
2. Log record count every 1000 records during import
3. Calculate and display records per second
4. Log total records imported
5. Log total import duration
6. Create structured log file with timestamp
7. Display progress to stdout during import
8. Log errors with context (which record, what error)
9. Include configuration details in log (source file, CRS, etc.)
10. Support different log levels (INFO, WARN, ERROR)

## Implementation Plan

1. Create logging utility functions in import script
2. Add timestamp function: `log_timestamp()`
3. Add logging functions:
   - `log_info(message)`
   - `log_warn(message)`
   - `log_error(message)`
4. Create log directory: `logs/`
5. Generate log filename with timestamp: `logs/import-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.log`
6. Add tee command to send output to both stdout and log file
7. Add progress monitoring for ogr2ogr with -progress flag:
   ```bash
   ogr2ogr -progress ...
   ```
8. Log pre-import configuration:
   - Source GeoJSON file path
   - File size
   - Source CRS
   - Target CRS
   - Field mapping file
   - Record count estimate
9. Log post-import summary:
   - Total records inserted
   - Duration
   - Records per second
   - Any errors encountered
10. Update all scripts to use logging functions

## Test Plan

**Objective**: Verify logging provides useful progress and error information

**Test Scope**: Logging functionality across all scripts

**Key Test Scenarios**:
1. Log file is created with correct timestamp
2. Import progress is logged every 1000 records
3. Start and end times are logged
4. Duration is calculated correctly
5. Records per second metric is accurate
6. Errors are logged with full context
7. Log output is both displayed and saved to file

**Success Criteria**: 
- Structured log files created
- Progress updates appear during import
- Performance metrics are accurate
- Errors are logged with sufficient detail for debugging
- Log format is consistent and parseable

## Verification

- [x] Log directory created: `logs/`
- [x] Logging functions added to import script
- [x] Log files created with timestamp naming: `logs/import-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.log`
- [x] Import start/end logged with timestamps
- [x] Progress logging functions implemented
- [x] Record count logged
- [x] Duration calculated and logged with human-readable format
- [x] Records per second calculated and displayed
- [x] Errors logged with context and log levels
- [x] Configuration details logged (file, CRS, mode, database)
- [x] All output logged to file with timestamps and levels
- [x] Tested with dry-run mode - logging verified working

## Files Modified

- `scripts/import-parcels.sh` (modified - comprehensive logging added)
- `logs/` (new directory with .gitkeep)
- `logs/.gitkeep` (new file)

## Implementation Notes

Successfully implemented comprehensive logging system:

1. **Log File Creation**:
   - Created `logs/` directory with `.gitkeep` file
   - Log files named with timestamp: `logs/import-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.log`
   - All log files excluded from git (already in .gitignore)

2. **Logging Functions Added**:
   - `log_timestamp()`: Returns ISO 8601 formatted timestamp
   - `log_timestamp_filename()`: Returns filename-safe timestamp
   - `init_log_file()`: Creates log file with header
   - `log_to_file()`: Core logging function with log levels
   - Updated all `print_*` functions to also log to file

3. **Configuration Logging**:
   - `log_configuration()`: Logs all import settings
   - Includes: file path, file size, CRS, county, mode, database details

4. **Performance Tracking**:
   - `calculate_duration()`: Calculates elapsed time in seconds
   - `format_duration()`: Formats as human-readable (e.g., "2m 30s")
   - `log_import_summary()`: Logs start/end times, duration, records/sec
   - START_TIME and END_TIME tracked throughout import

5. **Log Levels**:
   - INFO: General progress and status messages
   - SUCCESS: Successful operations
   - WARN: Warnings and non-critical issues
   - ERROR: Critical errors with context

6. **Log Format**:
   ```
   [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS] [LEVEL] Message
   ```

7. **Testing**:
   - Verified with dry-run mode
   - Log file created with correct timestamp naming
   - All messages logged with proper levels and timestamps
   - Console output maintains color coding
   - Log file contains structured, parseable format
   - Tested with actual Montgomery County import (325,071 records)

8. **Bug Fixes & Enhancements**:
   - Fixed `get_record_count()` to use `-al -so` instead of SQL query for GeoJSON files
   - Fixed `log_import_summary()` to query actual imported count from database
   - Performance metrics now calculated using real imported record count
   - Records per second calculation now accurate (e.g., 11,192 records/second for 29s import)
   - Added `RESTART IDENTITY` to TRUNCATE command to reset BIGSERIAL sequence in REPLACE mode
   - IDs now start from 1 on each fresh import instead of continuing from previous values

**Example Log Output**:
