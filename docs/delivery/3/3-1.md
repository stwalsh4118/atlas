# [3-1] Research and document import tools

[Back to task list](./tasks.md)

## Description

Research and document the capabilities and usage patterns for shapefile import tools (shp2pgsql and ogr2ogr). This task will create comprehensive guides for both tools with example commands, parameter options, and best practices specific to our parcel data import needs.

This foundational research will inform the implementation approach for subsequent import pipeline tasks.

## Requirements

1. Research shp2pgsql command-line options and usage
2. Research ogr2ogr command-line options and usage  
3. Document CRS transformation capabilities for both tools
4. Document geometry type handling (Polygon → MultiPolygon)
5. Document error handling and validation features
6. Create guide documents for each tool with examples
7. Include performance considerations for large datasets (50k-500k records)
8. Document installation and availability of each tool

## Implementation Plan

1. Web search for shp2pgsql documentation and usage patterns
2. Web search for ogr2ogr (GDAL) documentation
3. Research CRS transformation syntax for both tools (EPSG:2278 → EPSG:4326)
4. Create guide document: `3-1-shp2pgsql-guide.md`
5. Create guide document: `3-1-ogr2ogr-guide.md`
6. Document:
   - Installation requirements
   - Common command patterns for parcel data
   - CRS transformation syntax
   - Geometry type conversion options
   - Spatial index creation
   - Error handling and validation
   - Performance tuning options
   - Example commands for Montgomery County data

## Test Plan

**Objective**: Ensure the documented approaches are technically accurate and complete

**Test Scope**: Documentation validation (no code implementation in this task)

**Key Test Scenarios**:
1. Documentation includes installation instructions for each tool
2. Documentation includes complete command examples with explanations
3. Documentation covers CRS transformation syntax
4. Documentation addresses geometry validation
5. Documentation includes performance considerations

**Success Criteria**: 
- Two guide documents created with all required sections
- Command examples are syntactically correct
- Documentation is actionable for implementation in subsequent tasks
- Links to official documentation included

## Verification

- [x] Guide document created at `docs/delivery/3/3-1-shp2pgsql-guide.md`
- [x] Guide document created at `docs/delivery/3/3-1-ogr2ogr-guide.md`
- [x] Documents include installation instructions
- [x] Documents include CRS transformation examples
- [x] Documents include geometry type handling examples
- [x] Documents include error handling approaches
- [x] Documents include performance tuning options
- [x] Documents include links to official documentation
- [x] Documents include specific examples for parcel data import

## Implementation Notes

- Created comprehensive shp2pgsql guide covering all command options, CRS transformation, field mapping challenges, and performance considerations
- Created comprehensive ogr2ogr guide as alternative approach with built-in field renaming capabilities
- Documented two-stage import approach (staging table + SQL mapping) as recommended solution for MVP
- Included Montgomery County, TX specific examples with EPSG:2278 → EPSG:4326 transformation
- Documented performance expectations: 50k parcels in 30-90 seconds (shp2pgsql)
- Confirmed PostGIS 3.5.x is current version (released December 2024)
- Decided to use shp2pgsql for MVP due to better performance and simpler debugging
