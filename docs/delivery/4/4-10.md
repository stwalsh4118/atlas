# [4-10] Update API README with new architecture

[Back to task list](./tasks.md)

## Description

Update the API README.md to document the new architecture, configuration options, environment variables, and how to run the refactored application. Replace outdated information about the basic HTTP server with comprehensive documentation of the Gin-based API.

## Requirements

1. Update README.md in api/ directory
2. Document new architecture components:
   - Gin HTTP framework
   - pgx v5 connection pooling
   - Zerolog structured logging
   - Viper configuration management
   - Middleware stack
3. Document all environment variables with descriptions
4. Update running instructions
5. Document available endpoints
6. Add troubleshooting section
7. Update examples with curl commands
8. Document development workflow

## Implementation Plan

1. Update `api/README.md`
2. Update "Technology Stack" section:
   - Gin v1.10+ for HTTP routing
   - pgx v5 for database operations
   - zerolog for structured logging
   - viper for configuration
3. Add "Architecture Overview" section with component diagram
4. Update "Environment Variables" section with complete list:
   ```
   # Server Configuration
   PORT=8080                    # API server port
   ENV=development              # Environment (development/production)
   
   # Database Configuration
   DB_HOST=host.docker.internal # Database host
   DB_PORT=5432                 # Database port
   DB_USER=postgres             # Database user
   DB_PASSWORD=postgres         # Database password
   DB_NAME=atlas                # Database name
   DB_POOL_MIN=2                # Minimum pool connections
   DB_POOL_MAX=10               # Maximum pool connections
   
   # CORS Configuration
   CORS_ORIGINS=http://localhost:3000,http://localhost:3001
   ```
5. Update "Getting Started" section with new startup instructions
6. Add "Available Endpoints" section:
   - GET /health
   - GET /health/ready
   - GET /api/v1/info
7. Add "Development" section with:
   - Running the server
   - Running tests
   - Running linter
   - Viewing logs
8. Add "Troubleshooting" section with common issues
9. Add curl examples for testing endpoints
10. Remove outdated GORM references (or clarify pgx is used)

## Test Plan

**Objective**: Verify documentation is accurate and complete

**Test Scope**: README documentation accuracy and completeness

**Key Test Scenarios**:
1. Following README instructions starts the application
2. All environment variables are documented correctly
3. Curl examples work as documented
4. Troubleshooting section addresses common issues
5. Architecture description matches implementation

**Success Criteria**:
- README is clear and comprehensive
- A new developer can start the API using only README
- All endpoints are documented with examples
- Environment variables match actual configuration
- Manual verification: follow README to start API from scratch

## Verification

- [ ] README.md updated with new architecture
- [ ] Technology stack section updated
- [ ] Architecture overview added
- [ ] All environment variables documented
- [ ] Endpoint documentation added with examples
- [ ] Getting started instructions updated
- [ ] Development workflow documented
- [ ] Troubleshooting section added
- [ ] Curl examples provided and tested
- [ ] GORM references removed/clarified
- [ ] Manual test: Follow README to start API
- [ ] Manual test: Verify all curl examples work

## Files Modified

- `api/README.md` (updated - major revision)
