# [4-3] Create database connection pool with pgx

[Back to task list](./tasks.md)

## Description

Implement a database package that creates and manages a PostgreSQL connection pool using pgx v5. The package should handle connection pooling configuration, health checks, and provide a clean interface for acquiring database connections throughout the application.

This replaces any GORM usage with direct pgx connection pooling for better control over spatial queries.

## Requirements

1. Create database package in internal/database/
2. Implement NewPostgresPool() function using pgxpool
3. Configure connection pool with min/max connections from config
4. Set appropriate timeouts (connect, idle, max lifetime)
5. Enable PostGIS type awareness if needed
6. Implement Ping() health check method
7. Implement Close() method for graceful shutdown
8. Return proper error messages for connection failures
9. Log connection pool creation success/failure

## Implementation Plan

1. Create `api/internal/database/postgres.go`
2. Define Database struct:
   ```go
   type Database struct {
       Pool *pgxpool.Pool
   }
   ```
3. Implement NewPostgresPool():
   - Accept DatabaseConfig as parameter
   - Build connection string (DSN)
   - Configure pgxpool.Config with pool settings
   - Set timeouts (MaxConnLifetime, MaxConnIdleTime)
   - Create connection pool using pgxpool.NewWithConfig()
   - Test connection with immediate Ping()
   - Return Database instance or error
4. Implement Ping() method:
   - Use Pool.Ping(ctx) to verify connectivity
   - Return error if ping fails
5. Implement Close() method:
   - Call Pool.Close()
   - Log closure
6. Handle connection string format:
   ```
   postgres://user:password@host:port/dbname?sslmode=disable
   ```
7. Add comprehensive error messages for common issues

## Test Plan

**Objective**: Verify database connection pool is created successfully and health checks work

**Test Scope**: Connection pool creation, configuration, and health checks

**Key Test Scenarios**:
1. Successfully create connection pool with valid configuration
2. Connection pool respects min/max connection limits
3. Ping() succeeds when database is available
4. Ping() fails gracefully when database is unavailable
5. Close() cleanly shuts down connection pool
6. Invalid credentials return appropriate error
7. Invalid host/port return appropriate error

**Success Criteria**:
- Connection pool created with correct pool size settings
- Successful ping on pool creation
- Health check works correctly
- Proper error messages for connection failures
- Integration test passes with real PostgreSQL database

## Verification

- [x] postgres.go created with Database struct
- [x] NewPostgresPool() implemented with pgxpool
- [x] Connection pool configured with min/max from config
- [x] Timeouts set appropriately (5s connect, 30s idle, 1h max lifetime)
- [x] Ping() method implemented
- [x] Close() method implemented
- [x] Connection string built correctly from config
- [x] Error handling for connection failures
- [x] Integration test created that:
  - Connects to test database
  - Verifies ping works
  - Verifies connection pool created
  - Tests error cases (invalid host, credentials)
  - Tests Stats() method
  - Tests Close() multiple times
- [x] Integration tests pass (87.0% coverage)

## Implementation Notes

- Database package successfully implemented using pgx v5 and pgxpool
- Connection pool properly configured with min/max connections, timeouts, and health checks
- Connection DSN built securely from config (sslmode=disable for local development)
- Comprehensive error handling for connection failures
- Ping() and Close() methods for health checks and graceful shutdown
- Stats() method added for monitoring connection pool usage
- Integration tests verify functionality with real PostgreSQL database
- Test coverage: 87.0% (excellent coverage including error paths)
- All 8 integration test cases pass successfully

## Files Modified

- `api/internal/database/postgres.go` (new)
- `api/internal/database/postgres_test.go` (new)
